# Priority_Assessment-data-hypothesis-testing

BACKGROUND: Software development projects typically follow six basic phases: Requirements,
design, implementation (and integration), testing (validation), deployment (installation) and
maintenance.The group’s project manager wastasked with
studying problems within the implementation phase. He found thatsoftware engineers were
having difficulty prioritizing their work, and that they often became overwhelmed by the
magnitude of the projects.
As a result, two changes were made. Each project was broken down into smaller, distinct
tasks, or jobs, and each job was assigned a priority. 

BUSINESS PROBLEM: We will focus on the prioritization system. If the system is working, then
high priority jobs, on average, should be completed more quickly than medium priority jobs,
and medium priority jobs should be completed more quickly than low priority jobs. Use the
data provided to determine whether thisis, in fact, occurring.

DATA AVAILABLE:
 Priority_Assessment.csv


The data set contains a random sample of 642 jobs completed over the last six months. The
variables in the data set are:
Days The number of days it took to complete the job
Priority The priority level assigned to that job
